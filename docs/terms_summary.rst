The most relevant terms and phrases (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams) are extracted from the pages in the current view of DDT and listed in the Terms Tab on the left panel, as shown in the figure above. This provides a summary of the pages currently in view. Initially, when there are no annotated terms, the top 40 terms  with the highest TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) are selected.  The terms are displayed with their frequency of occurrence in relevant (blue) and irrelevant (red) pages (bars to the right of the Terms panel). This helps the expert to select terms that are more discerning of relevant pages.

Terms can be tagged as ’Positive’ and ’Negative’ by 1-click and 2-click respectively. The tags are stored in the active data source. When the update terms button is clicked, the positively and negatively annotated terms are used to re-rank the other terms. Terms help the expert understand and discover new information about the domains of interest. The terms can be used to refine the Web search or start new sub topic searches.

Custom relevant and irrelevant terms can be added by clicking the + button to boost the extraction of more relevant terms. These custom terms are distinguised by the delete icon before them which can be clicked to delete the custom term.

Hovering the mouse over the terms in the Terms window displays the context in which they appear on the pages. This again helps the expert understand and disambiguate the relevant terms. Inspect the terms extracted in the "Terms" window. Clicking on the stop button pins the context to the corresponding term.
